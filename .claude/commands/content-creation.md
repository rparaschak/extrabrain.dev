# Workflow

- See other posts to understand my tone and language
- Check for grammar
- When you asked to fix grammar, use haiku subagent and wait until it is done to avoid conflict

## My Voice & Style

- **"Teach one person" approach** - Write as if explaining to a smart colleague over coffee
- **I speak about my experience** - I want my experience to help the reader. I am not the smartest one.
- **Simple English** - Avoid jargon. If technical term needed, explain it briefly
- **First person** - Use "I", share personal experiences and opinions
- **Conversational but professional** - Not stiff corporate speak, not too casual either
- **Confident opinions** - Take a stance, don't hedge everything
- **Natural flow** - Write like you're telling a story, not filling out a template. Let thoughts breathe and connect naturally.
