# AE Guide for Backend

You hear about AI + coding everywhere. AI-Assisted Coding, vibe coding, etc. Where to start?

## Background
My team uses coding agents every day. We write 99% of the code using AI. The quality is at least as high as without the AI, but the output is much higher.
Why? Because AI amplified our strong habits and I will explain what we do exactly to achieve extraordinary results.

## Theory
LLMs are simple: `Garbage In -> Garbage out`
If your codebase has a smell, AI will produce even more code with smell.

You are the pilot, AI is the aircraft. Pilot tells the aircraft where to go. Not vice versa.

## Step #1: Automated Testing
Congrats, if you have a strong automated testing suite then you are one step ahead.

If not, also congrats, that is the best way to start and kill two rabbits.
